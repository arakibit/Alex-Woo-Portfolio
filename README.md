Hi there, welcome to my hub.

I've outlined couple of projects that I have worked on for your reference. 
# [Project 1: Bank Customer Clustering](https://github.com/arakibit/portfolio/tree/main/Data%20Science/Projects/Bank_CreditCard_Analysis)
* Involves segmenting the bank customers to help the bank upgrading the service delivery model and ensure that customers queries are resolved faster
* Used EDA, Clustering

# [Project 2: Cancellation of hotel bookings](https://github.com/arakibit/portfolio/tree/main/Data%20Science/Projects/Predicting_Hotel_Cancellation_Rates)
* The first part of this project involves predicting house prices in the Boston area based on the features of the locality using regression techniques. 
* The second part involves predicting booking cancellations based on booking details and helping formulate profitable policies for cancellations and refunds.
* Used Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, kNN

# [Project 3: Amazon Product Recommendation System](https://github.com/arakibit/portfolio/tree/main/Data%20Science/Projects/Amazon_Recommendation_System)
* This project involves recommending the best amazon products available to the users by using some recommendation systems techniques.
* Used Rank Based Recommendation Systems, Similarity Based Recommendation Systems, Matrix Factorization Based Recommendation Systems

# [Project 4: Predicting Used Car Prices](https://github.com/arakibit/portfolio/tree/main/Data%20Science/Projects/Predicting_UsedCar_Prices)
* Used linear regression, ridge/lasso regression, decision trees, random forest to compare across different models and identify best performing model
* Linear regression performed the best out of the other models
* Recommended ways to improve model accuracy (e.g. collecting data more relevant to purchasers)
